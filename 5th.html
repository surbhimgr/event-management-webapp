<p style="color:lawngreen;">
 A cultural fest is a fest that showcases the culture adopted by the college organizing it. Every year, a college adopts a particular theme and organizes various events related to it. The college premises are also usually decorated accordingly, thus giving it all a “cultural” look. A cultural fest is the flagship event of the college and is open to students from all colleges irrespective of their fields/specializations, thus providing a great opportunity to mingle and network with others from various walks of life.
